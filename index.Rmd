# Introduction

The aim of page is to:

1.  Document the process of setting up the SWAT+ and SWAP models for Kraakstad, Norway (Case study 10 / CS10)

2.  Link and execute all workflow steps in parallel with the documentation using `Rmarkdown`

3.  Make the model setup process reproducible

4.  Be a reference to the CS10 modelers, as well as other OPTAIN modelers.

If all goes well, the compiling of this Gitbook will also compile the OPTAIN model setup in tandem, from source input files to final model setup (..and beyond!)

The model setup follows the OPTAIN modelling protocols for SWAP [@farkas2023] and SWAT+ [@sch√ºrz2022]. We begin with SWAT+ and the model setup with SWATBuildR, in section \@ref(model-setup-with-swatbuildr).
