[["index.html", "OPTAIN CS-10 Introduction", " OPTAIN CS-10 Moritz Shore, Csilla Farkas 2023-06-08 Introduction The aim of page is to: Document the process of setting up the SWAT+ and SWAP models for Kraakstad, Norway (Case study 10 / CS10) Link and execute all workflow steps in parallel with the documentation using Rmarkdown Make the model setup process reproducible Be a reference to the CS10 modelers, as well as other OPTAIN modelers. If all goes well, the compiling of this GitBook will also compile the OPTAIN model setup in tandem, from source input files to final model setup (..and beyond!) The model setup follows the OPTAIN modelling protocols for SWAP (Farkas et al. 2023) and SWAT+ (Sch√ºrz et al. 2022). We begin with SWAT+ and the input file preperation for SWATBuildR, in Section 1.
