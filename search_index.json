If all goes well, the compiling of this GitBook will also compile the OPTAIN model setup in tandem, from source input files to final model setup (..and beyond!) Figure 0.1: An Overview of the CS10 Watershed: Kraakstad The model setup follows the OPTAIN modelling protocols for SWAP (Farkas et al. 2023) and SWAT+ (Schürz et al. 2022). We begin with SWAT+ and the input file preparation for SWATBuildR, in Section 1.
