# Crop map generations

As OPTAIN takes into account the individual field, we need to know what is
growing on which field and when. Unfortunately our data foundation for this task
is quite lackluster, but we will try out best to do so. in the following
chapter.

## Farm and field area

We have data based on what area certain crops have per farm. In order to relate
this to our spatial land use map, we require the area of both the farms, and 
the fields within these farms.

### Calculate Farm area and assign IDs

This stage has been completed in QGIS. An R-implementation is being
considered.

## Generate crop map from farm data

The following script takes information from reporting farm, and their
respective area in the SWAT+ setup, and combines these data sets to
generate a plausible crop rotation.
