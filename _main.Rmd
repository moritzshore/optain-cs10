# Introduction

This is the documentation for the OPTAIN-CS10 Project.

## Usage

Each **bookdown** chapter is an .Rmd file, and each .Rmd file can contain one (and only one) chapter. A chapter *must* start with a first-level heading: `# A good chapter`, and can contain one (and only one) first-level heading.

Use second-level and higher headings within chapters like: `## A short section` or `### An even shorter section`.

The `index.Rmd` file is required, and is also your first book chapter. It will be the homepage when you render the book.

## Render book

You can render the HTML version of this example book without changing anything:

1.  Find the **Build** pane in the RStudio IDE, and

2.  Click on **Build Book**, then select your output format, or select "All formats" if you'd like to use multiple formats from the same book source files.

Or build the book from the R console:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
bookdown::render_book()
```

To render this example to PDF as a `bookdown::pdf_book`, you'll need to install XeLaTeX. You are recommended to install TinyTeX (which includes XeLaTeX): <https://yihui.org/tinytex/>.

## Preview book

As you work, you may start a local server to live preview this HTML book. This preview will update as you edit the book when you save individual .Rmd files. You can start the server in a work session by using the RStudio add-in "Preview book", or from the R console:

```{r eval=FALSE}
bookdown::serve_book()
```

```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown'
), 'packages.bib')
```

# Model setup with SWATBuildR

The OPTAIN project is using the COCOA approach @schürz2022 and as such, needs to use the `SWATBuildR` package to calculate the connectivity between HRUs in the catchment. This chapter covers this process.

We will define the location of our project here:

```{r}
project_path <- 'model_data/cs10_setup'
```

And give it the name:

```{r}
project_name <- 'optain-cs10'
```

Much of this documentation has been lost to time.

## High-Resolution Digital Elevation Model (DEM)

The high-resolution DEM is the basis for calculation of water connectivity, among other things. Most of the documentation of the creation of the DEM for CS10 has been lost to the sands of time. All we know is that it is located here:

```{r}
dem_path <- "model_data/input/elevation/dtm3_ns_v5.tif"
```

To our knowledge, it has a 10 meter resolution. 1 meter resolution was available but there seems to have been issues with using it. It is definitely preferable to use the 1m DEM as certain important information can be lost with (max allowed resolution) of 10m, see Figure \@ref(fig:dempic).

![ #label:dempic An example of a hydrologically effective landscape features being lost due to coarse DEM resolution. From[@schürz2022]](figures/1mdemvs10.png)

## Basin Boundary

The basin boundary has presumably been created using the defined outlet point of the catchment and the DEM. No more is currently known about this file other than that it is located here:

```{r}
bound_path <- "model_data/input/shape/cs10_basin.shp"
```

We will begin using the `SWATBuildR` Package by initializing its functions. (Note: this package is currently unfinished, which is why this step is necessary).

The following code is from version `1.5.12`, and written by Christoph Schuerz.

Another note: there are currently issues with White box which are being resolved.

```{r, message=FALSE}
source('model_data/swat_buildR/init.R')
```

First, we read in and check the basin boundary

```{r}
# Read and prepare input data --------------------------------------
## Basin boundary
bound <- read_sf(bound_path) %>% select()
set_proj_crs(bound, data_path)
check_polygon_topology(layer = bound, data_path =  data_path, label = 'basin', 
                       n_feat = 1, checks = c(F,T,T,T,F,F,F,F))
```

## Land layer

```{r}
land_path <- '../input_files/landuse/cs10_lu_id_fixed.shp'
land_path <- "model_data/input/"
```

```{r}
land <- read_sf(land_path) %>% 
  check_layer_attributes(., type_to_lower = FALSE) %>%
  check_project_crs(layer = ., data_path =  data_path, proj_layer = project_layer, 
                    label = 'land', type = 'vector')
```

# Cross-references {#cross}

Cross-references make it easier for your readers to find and link to elements in your book.

## Chapters and sub-chapters

There are two steps to cross-reference any heading:

1. Label the heading: `# Hello world {#nice-label}`. 
    - Leave the label off if you like the automated heading generated based on your heading title: for example, `# Hello world` = `# Hello world {#hello-world}`.
    - To label an un-numbered heading, use: `# Hello world {-#nice-label}` or `{# Hello world .unnumbered}`.

1. Next, reference the labeled heading anywhere in the text using `\@ref(nice-label)`; for example, please see Chapter \@ref(cross). 
    - If you prefer text as the link instead of a numbered reference use: [any text you want can go here](#cross).

## Captioned figures and tables

Figures and tables *with captions* can also be cross-referenced from elsewhere in your book using `\@ref(fig:chunk-label)` and `\@ref(tab:chunk-label)`, respectively.

See Figure \@ref(fig:nice-fig).

```{r nice-fig, fig.cap='Here is a nice figure!', out.width='80%', fig.asp=.75, fig.align='center', fig.alt='Plot with connected points showing that vapor pressure of mercury increases exponentially as temperature increases.'}
par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1))
plot(pressure, type = 'b', pch = 19)
```

Don't miss Table \@ref(tab:nice-tab).

```{r nice-tab, tidy=FALSE}
knitr::kable(
  head(pressure, 10), caption = 'Here is a nice table!',
  booktabs = TRUE
)
```

# (PART) Act one {-}

# A chapter

You can add parts to organize one or more book chapters together. Parts can be inserted at the top of an .Rmd file, before the first-level chapter heading in that same file. 

Add a numbered part: `# (PART) Act one {-}` (followed by `# A chapter`)

Add an unnumbered part: `# (PART\*) Act one {-}` (followed by `# A chapter`)

Add an appendix as a special kind of un-numbered part: `# (APPENDIX) Other stuff {-}` (followed by `# A chapter`). Chapters in an appendix are prepended with letters instead of numbers.

# Footnotes and citations 

## Footnotes

Footnotes are put inside the square brackets after a caret `^[]`. Like this one ^[This is a footnote.]. 

## Citations

Reference items in your bibliography file(s) using `@key`.

For example, we are using the **bookdown** package [@R-bookdown] (check out the last code chunk in index.Rmd to see how this citation key was added) in this sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and **knitr** [@xie2015] (this citation was added manually in an external file book.bib). 
Note that the `.bib` files need to be listed in the index.Rmd with the YAML `bibliography` key.


The RStudio Visual Markdown Editor can also make it easier to insert citations: <https://rstudio.github.io/visual-markdown-editing/#/citations>

# Blocks

## Equations

Here is an equation.

\begin{equation} 
  f\left(k\right) = \binom{n}{k} p^k\left(1-p\right)^{n-k}
  (\#eq:binom)
\end{equation} 

You may refer to using `\@ref(eq:binom)`, like see Equation \@ref(eq:binom).


## Theorems and proofs

Labeled theorems can be referenced in text using `\@ref(thm:tri)`, for example, check out this smart theorem \@ref(thm:tri).

::: {.theorem #tri}
For a right triangle, if $c$ denotes the *length* of the hypotenuse
and $a$ and $b$ denote the lengths of the **other** two sides, we have
$$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$

# Sharing your book

## Publishing

HTML books can be published online, see: https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/publishing.html

## 404 pages

By default, users will be directed to a 404 page if they try to access a webpage that cannot be found. If you'd like to customize your 404 page instead of using the default, you may add either a `_404.Rmd` or `_404.md` file to your project root and use code and/or Markdown syntax.

## Metadata for sharing

Bookdown HTML books will provide HTML metadata for social sharing on platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn, using information you provide in the `index.Rmd` YAML. To setup, set the `url` for your book and the path to your `cover-image` file. Your book's `title` and `description` are also used.



This `gitbook` uses the same social sharing data across all chapters in your book- all links shared will look the same.

Specify your book's source repository on GitHub using the `edit` key under the configuration options in the `_output.yml` file, which allows users to suggest an edit by linking to a chapter's source file. 

Read more about the features of this output format here:

https://pkgs.rstudio.com/bookdown/reference/gitbook.html

Or use:

```{r eval=FALSE}
?bookdown::gitbook
```
